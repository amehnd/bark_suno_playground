Exploring Bark by Suno — a powerful text-to-audio model that generates human-like speech. This repo documents my testing, findings, and thoughts as I dig into what it can do.

# Bark Experiments

Welcome! This repo is where I’m exploring [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) by Suno — a cutting-edge text-to-audio model that generates incredibly realistic speech (and even music and sound effects).

## Why Bark?

I’m curious about how far text-to-speech has come, and Bark seems like a big step forward. It supports multiple languages, speaker styles, emotions, and more — all without needing training data from your own voice.

## What I’m Doing Here

- Testing Bark’s TTS capabilities with different prompts
- Trying out multilingual and emotional speech generation

## Getting Started

To try it yourself, check out the official Bark repo [here](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark). I’ll be adding notes, sample outputs, and setup steps as I go.

## Status

Just getting started — more updates and insights to come.
